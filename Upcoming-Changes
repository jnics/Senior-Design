Notice when someone wins
make so the initial window fits the game
make sure that game changes size as window does
make a drawing board to the side of the game that will follow score
add a window so when game is over it pops up with tips
make a method that checks to see if any of the colors are the same and if so it makes one brighter and one darker then rechecks colors
add sounds on a win maybe a hit a loss of life and any other event that may occur that sound could add to the game.
